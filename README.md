## C++
* [SVM-Light](http://svmlight.joachims.org/) - Distributed as C++ source and binaries for Linux, Windows, Cygwin, and Solaris. Kernels: polynomial, radial basis function, and neural (tanh).
* [SVM-Struct](http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_struct.html) - An SVM implementation that can model complex (multivariate) output data y, such as trees, sequences, or sets. Several implementations exist: SVMmulticlass, for multi-class classification; SVMcfg, learns a weighted context free grammar from examples; SVMalign, learns to align protein sequences from training alignments; SVMhmm, learns a Markov model from examples.
* [my-SVM](http://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/SOFTWARE/MYSVM/index.html) - An implementation of SVM classification and regression. It includes the following kernels : linear, polynomial, radial basis function, neural (tanh), anova.
* [SVM-Torch](http://www.idiap.ch/learning/SVMTorch.html) - It is part of the Torch machine learning library and implements SVM classification and regression.
* [GPDT](http://dm.unife.it/gpdt/) - A C++ implementation for large-scale SVM classification in both scalar and distributed memory parallel environments. Available as C++ source code and Windows binaries.
* [HeroSvm](http://www.cenparmi.concordia.ca/~people/jdong/HeroSvm.html) -  Implements SVM classification, and is distributed as a dynamic link library for Windows. Kernels: linear, polynomial, radial basis function.
* [SvmFu](http://five-percent-nation.mit.edu/SvmFu/) - A C++ package for SVM classification. Kernels: linear, polynomial, and Gaussian radial basis function.
