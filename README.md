## C
* [M-SVM](http://www.loria.fr/~guermeur/) - Multi-class SVM implementation in C by Guermeur. 
* [Gist](http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/gist/) - Gist is a C implementation of support vector machine classification and kernel principal components analysis.
* [SVMsequel](http://www.isi.edu/~hdaume/SVMsequel/) - SVM multi-class classification package, distributed as binaries for Linux or Solaris. Kernels: linear, polynomial, radial basis function, sigmoid, string, tree, information diffusion on discrete manifolds.

 <a name="cpp"></a>
## C++
* [SVM-Light](http://svmlight.joachims.org/) - Distributed as C++ source and binaries for Linux, Windows, Cygwin, and Solaris. Kernels: polynomial, radial basis function, and neural (tanh).
* [SVM-Struct](http://svmlight.joachims.org/svm_struct.html) - An SVM implementation that can model complex (multivariate) output data y, such as trees, sequences, or sets. Several implementations exist: SVMmulticlass, for multi-class classification; SVMcfg, learns a weighted context free grammar from examples; SVMalign, learns to align protein sequences from training alignments; SVMhmm, learns a Markov model from examples.
* [my-SVM](http://www-ai.cs.uni-dortmund.de/SOFTWARE/MYSVM/index.html) - An implementation of SVM classification and regression. It includes the following kernels : linear, polynomial, radial basis function, neural (tanh), anova.
* [SVM-Torch](http://www.idiap.ch/learning/SVMTorch.html) - It is part of the Torch machine learning library and implements SVM classification and regression.
* [GPDT](http://dm.unife.it/gpdt/) - An implementation for large-scale SVM classification in both scalar and distributed memory parallel environments. Also available as  Windows binaries.
* [HeroSvm](http://www.cenparmi.concordia.ca/~people/jdong/HeroSvm.html) -  Implements SVM classification, and is distributed as a dynamic link library for Windows. Kernels: linear, polynomial, radial basis function.
* [SvmFu](http://five-percent-nation.mit.edu/SvmFu/) - A package for SVM classification. Kernels: linear, polynomial, and Gaussian radial basis function.
* [TinySVM](http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySVM/) - An  implementation of C-classification and C-regression which uses sparse vector representation.
